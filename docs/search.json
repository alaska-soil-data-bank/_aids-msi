It seems I can do basic operations in python on large datasets without much of a problem, however question about what happens when you try larger projects or more demanding models #to-do\nIf you are simply doing work with file transfers or want to see what is on your Tier 1 storage, just ssh in. The simplest way to do this natively on a Mac is to use OpenSSH, which is pre-installed on Mac OSX. To do this, open the terminal application (Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal) and type:\nMy username (x500) is jeli0026, you would simply use your own. NOTE: if you are not on a umn campus network, then you will need to VPN in first, using the Cisco AnyConnect Client. If you are on a UMN network, then you don’t need the VPN.\nYou will then be prompted to enter your password - this should be your UMN password. This will be followed by a Duo authentication request and options. Once you have approved the Duo authentication request, you are in.",

Irf says an scp protocol might work, but it looks to me like this is only from a local machine. Maybe also look into FileZilla? This is important because we need a connection to the Google Cloud Console bucket that Timm maintains in order to directly pull covariates instead of putting them local and then putting them up on MSI (although this is a workaround if necessary).",
